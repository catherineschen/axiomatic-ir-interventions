# Setup

This code uses a fork of the [TransformerLens](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens) package, which we make additional changes to support activation patching in a retrieval setting. (A copy of the unofficial fork can be temporarily found in the submission code [here](https://github.com/catherineschen/tasb-transformer-lens).)

# Code

We provide a demo of how we perform activation patching for retrieval in `retrieval_patching_demo.py`. 

```
python retrieval_patching_demo.py
